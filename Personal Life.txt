<li>My name is Riyaz.</li> 

<li>I was born in a little town called Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu, South India, on January 16, 1994.</li> 

<li>Soon after though, my family moved to Qatar where I have spent the rest of my life until now.</li>

<li>Back in my childhood days, I was very adventurous; always willing to jump into new situations and experiment with new things.</li>

<li>I wasn't a top of the line school nerd but I would fit in the higher range of the above-average category in my studies and sometimes actually top the class.</li>

<li>Technology fascinated me from a young age, so much so that I ended up fixing many of the things at home that were broke.</li>

<li>I wanted constant excitement at all times and hence I resorted to mischief to satisfy this need.</li>

<li>Over time, I added sports and martial arts to my list of fun activities.</li>

<li>But, mischief caused some physical setbacks along the way.</li>

<li>Multiple sprains, injuries, fractures became a usual thing for me and a nuisance for my parents.</li>

<li>After a major knee injury, I spent less time outdoors and more time indoors, reading and/or playing games.</li>

<li>Computers became a major source of my entertainment.</li>

<li>But, my mom made sure that I never screwed up my studies so there was never a problem when it counted for final grades.</li>

<li>Socializing seemed like a major annoyance from the experience I had accumulated so far through school, so I slowly changed into an introvert.</li>

<li>Fast forward a couple of boring high-school years filled with drama and nonsense, and into college.</li>

<li>That's when I started socializing more. Found people I could trust, have fun with and who could support me when I needed it.</li>

<li>I won't say I did'nt learn life lessons along the way but the ones which impacted my life a lot had to be from university.</li>

<li>Depression was a part of my life for a long time. But, I learned to overcome it bit by bit, with prayers and social support.</li>

<li>I found myself not afraid to speak out when needed, able to do good work if I genuinely showed interest and even started doing some physical activity again.</li>

<li>After graduating from college, I spent a lot of time thinking about what career path I should take to move forward.</li>

<li>I applied for a lot of jobs but when I did not get any promising replies, I started doing some self-study in my field of interest, Web Development.</li>

<li>Currently, I am learning and experimenting with what I can do with what I have and eventually I hope to get a job in this field by showcasing my accomplishments.</li>

<li>Hope my life summary wasn't too boring :)</li>
